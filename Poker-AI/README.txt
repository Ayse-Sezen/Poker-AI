Last few things that need to be done for project:
- Put in an 'exit game' option for user agent
- Impelement game over code
- Put game in a loop that runs for maybe 4-6 rounds?
- User needs to see the community cards and their own hole cards and pick their hand themselves. Picked hand will be processed through getHandScore() function to
identify what hand it is.
- Record Ai's wins and losses, maybe keep a total of how money money ai won and lost per game, write it off to a file, then tally up total amt won, total amt lost,
and total number of games played and spit out some stats based on that.
- Test the game out, make sure it works, and then play against it a few times so we can get stats for performance measures
- Do the write up
